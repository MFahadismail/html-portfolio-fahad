<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Mohammad Fahad Ismail, 
   originally from Pakistan but born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   My educational journey has taken me across different parts of the world.</p>

<p>I began my primary education at Jawahir International School in Riyadh, 
  progressing until the 3rd grade. Subsequently, I continued my education up 
  to the 5th grade at Pakistan International School Buraydah.</p>

<p>Skipping grades 6 and 7 led me to a new chapter in Bahawalpur, Pakistan.
   There, I pursued higher education, completing my matriculation in biology and advancing into 
   engineering for my intermediate studies. Following this academic phase, I took a unique path,
    gaining practical experience as a mechanic at a local workshop for two years.</p>

<p>Currently, I am passionately pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Iqra University, Karachi.
   This academic journey reflects my diverse experiences and the resilience that has shaped my path. 
   I am excited about the world of computer science and eager to
    contribute my skills to the ever-evolving field.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, you might find me exploring new technologies, 
  solving problems, or enjoying moments of creativity. 
  Join me on this exciting journey as I navigate the realms of 
  computer science and strive for continuous learning and growth!</p>
